Choose an alternate static front page to a specific daily period.

== Description ==

Front Page Scheduler let you choose some page to be shown as the front page of your site during a specific daily period, in specific week days. Since version 0.1.4, you can even create a set of "rules", choosing specific front pages for different days and periods.

*Update:* Benjamin Benkert fixed some bugs related to PHP versions 7 and greaters. Thanks!
